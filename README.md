# Phaser 3 Typescript Template

This is a basic template to start a Phaser 3 game using Typescript. It is based on the official [Phaser 3 Project Template](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) repository and M.S. Farzan's [tutorial for using Express to serve a Phaser game](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-multiplayer-card-game-with-phaser-3-express-and-socket-io/). It includes Jest as a testing library and the Typescript version of StandardJS for code formatting and linting.
